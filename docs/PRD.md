## User Avatar
### Sarah Collins
Sarah Collins is a Senior Project Manager at a mid-sized tech firm, overseeing multiple projects simultaneously. She is responsible for managing project timelines, resource allocation, and stakeholder communication. Sarah is highly organized and detail-oriented, with a strong background in project management. She typically works in fast-paced environments with cross-functional teams, handling budgets up to $500K and timelines spanning 6-12 months.

#### Needs and Pain Points
* Visualize complex project timelines and dependencies to spot inter-task relationships at a glance.
* Identify potential bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation to prevent resource overloads or delays.
* Communicate effectively with stakeholders through clear, shareable visuals rather than dense reports.
* Make data-driven decisions about project scheduling, backed by automated insights instead of manual calculations.

Pain points include time wasted on manual dependency mapping, overlooked critical paths leading to surprises, and difficulty in justifying adjustments to executives without visual evidence.

#### Current Workflow
1. Manually create project timelines using MS Excel or MS Project, often exporting data from other tools.
2. Analyze task dependencies and identify potential bottlenecks through spreadsheets or whiteboards, which is error-prone.
3. Communicate with team members and stakeholders to adjust project plans, relying on meetings and emails for feedback.

This workflow is inefficient, taking hours per update and lacking real-time analysis.

#### Goals and Expectations
* Improve project timeline visualization and analysis for faster insights.
* Reduce delays and cost overruns by 20-30% through early bottleneck detection.
* Enhance team productivity and collaboration with intuitive tools.
* Make data-driven decisions about project scheduling, supported by optimization suggestions.

Sarah expects a tool that's quick to learn, integrates seamlessly with existing data formats, and provides actionable recommendations without requiring advanced technical skills.

## Solution Architecture
The ProjectPulse application will be built using Java for the desktop client and H2 DB for data storage. The architecture will include the following components:

* **Data Import Component**: Handles CSV/JSON import functionality, parsing files into structured ProjectData objects.
* **Dependency Analysis Component**: Analyzes task dependencies and builds dependency graph using graph algorithms.
* **Visualization Component**: Visualizes project timeline using JavaFX, supporting interactive elements like zooming and highlighting.
* **Bottleneck Detection Component**: Identifies potential bottlenecks in the project timeline via degree centrality or critical path methods.
* **Optimization Suggestions Component**: Provides optimization strategies based on detected bottlenecks, such as resource reallocation or task parallelization.

### Technical Specifications
* **Programming Language**: Java 17+ for cross-platform compatibility and performance.
* **Database**: H2 DB, an embedded SQL database for lightweight, file-based storage without external servers.
* **UI Framework**: JavaFX for rich, responsive desktop interfaces with support for charts and graphs.
* **Data Import**: CSV/JSON import functionality using libraries like OpenCSV or Jackson for parsing.
* **Graph Handling**: Custom DependencyGraph class, potentially leveraging libraries like JGraphT if needed (though kept minimal).
* **Algorithms**: Dependency analysis via graph construction; bottleneck detection using node degree thresholds (e.g., nodes with degree > threshold as bottlenecks).
* **Environment**: Desktop-only, no web or mobile components in v1; assumes standard JVM installation.

### Technical Summary
ProjectPulse employs a modular, layered architecture to ensure maintainability and scalability. At its core is an embedded H2 database for persisting project data, queried via JDBC. The backend logic is divided into analyzers and detectors, implemented in pure Java for efficiency. The frontend uses JavaFX scenes and controls to render timelines as Gantt-like charts or dependency graphs, with event handlers for user interactions.

Data flows from import to analysis: Raw CSV/JSON is parsed into Task objects (with attributes like ID, name, duration, dependencies), stored in H2, then graphed. Visualization renders this graph dynamically, while detection algorithms traverse it to flag issues. Optimization logic applies heuristics, such as suggesting parallel tasks for high-degree nodes.

This design minimizes dependencies, ensuring the app runs offline with low resource usage (target: <100MB RAM). Future-proofing includes extensible components for adding export features or AI-based optimizations.

### System Design
The application's system design will follow a modular architecture, with each component responsible for a specific functionality.

#### Data Import Component
The Data Import Component will handle CSV/JSON import functionality, parsing the data into a format suitable for analysis. It validates input for required fields (e.g., task ID, dependencies) and handles errors gracefully.

#### Dependency Analysis Component
The Dependency Analysis Component will analyze task dependencies and build a dependency graph, enabling the identification of potential bottlenecks. It constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model task precedence.

#### Visualization Component
The Visualization Component will visualize the project timeline using JavaFX, providing an intuitive and interactive representation of the project plan. Users can interact via drag-and-drop or filters.

#### Bottleneck Detection Component
The Bottleneck Detection Component will identify potential bottlenecks in the project timeline, using algorithms to analyze the dependency graph. For example, it calculates node degrees or longest paths.

#### Optimization Suggestions Component
The Optimization Suggestions Component will provide optimization strategies based on detected bottlenecks, enabling project managers to adjust their project plans accordingly. Suggestions might include "Reassign resources to Task X" or "Parallelize Tasks Y and Z."
